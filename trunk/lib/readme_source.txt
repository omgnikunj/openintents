How to create the JAR file in Eclipse:
(you need the OpenIntents source code for this)

1) In the package explorer, right-click on project "OpenIntents/build-release.xml" /
   "Run As", then "Ant Build...".

2) In "Check targets to execute" choose "OpenIntents" and click "Run".
   (You may also choose "release-zip" to create the complete release).
