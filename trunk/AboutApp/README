OI About is a standalone about dialog that is shared between apps.

OI About is based on the GtkAboutDialog and for the bigger part has the 
same fields and layout.

As an app developer you use it in the following way, in short:

    * The user that installs your app also installs OI About or already 
      has it because he installed it before (for another app).
    * From your "about" menu option you start an activity with this 
      specific intent action.

Intent intent = new Intent(AboutIntents.ACTION_SHOW_ABOUT_DIALOG); 
startActivityForResult(intent, 0);

The activity needs to be launched "forResult" with requestCode>=0 so that 
the package name is passed properly. Optionally, one can set the intent 
extra org.openintents.extra.PACKAGE_NAME.

The data to be displayed in the About dialog, specific to your app, like 
app name, app version, license, logo, ... are retrieved from your 
application's Manifest meta-data.
Optionally they can be specified using intent extras.

And that's it really! No (real) need to import a lib into your project 
or anything. One shared application that handles all the "abouts" for 
apps, with a rather simple (and expandable) intent interface.

To code by example (recommended): OI About is a meta-example since it has 
a meta-about dialog about itself (and all the code to go with it). From 
About.java copy showAboutDialog() to your main activity. You can also 
copy some of the onCreateOptionsMenu(), OnOptionsItemSelected(), ... if 
you like. Then copy the first section of the Manifest. The Manifest has 
dependencies on some strings, arrays and other resources. You can either 
make OI About a dependency of your java project (so the constants hold), 
or you can replace the constants with the key/action strings themselves. 
You can copy the necessary elements from strings.xml, arrays.xml and other 
resources to your project and adapt them so they represent the information 
concerning your application. Also copy the ic_menu_info_details.png icon 
for any buttons/menus you create, or use 
android.R.drawable.ic_menu_info_details, and fix the imports of course. 
Not too hard, right?
