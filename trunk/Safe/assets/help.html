<h1>Help</h1>

<h2>Categories</h2>

<p>Categories are used to contain passwords.   You might have one for Work and 
 one for Personal.  This helps keep your passwords organized.</p>

<p>Begin by adding one via the Menu.   After you've created one, you can touch it
 to open that category.   Once a category is selected you may then create password entries.</p>


<h2>Passwords</h2>

<p>After first selecting a category, you may Edit, Add or Delete password entries
 from the Password List activity.</p>

<p>Password entries consist of the following fields:<p>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>Description is a required field.   This is what is shown in the password list.</dd>

<dt>Website</dt>
<dd>If appropriate, provide the full URL to the website associated with this entry.</dd>

<dt>Username</dt>
<dd>Username for the password, if appropriate.</dd>

<dt>Password</dt>
<dd>Finally the password itself.</dd>

<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>Miscellaneous notes about this entry.  You may type as much as you want, the field
 will expand to accommodate.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Master Password</h2>

<p>When you run OI Safe for the very first time, you are
   prompted for a 'Master Password'.  This password is
   used to encrypt a generated Master Key.   The Master Key is in turn
   used to encrypt and decrypt all the password entries.</p>
   
<p>Each time that you launch OI Safe, the Master Password that
   you type is used to decrypt, or unlock, the Master Key.  The Master
   Key is used to decrypt/encrypt the password entries.</p>
   
<p>The Master Key does not change.  When you use the 'Change Master Password'
   Menu option, you are merely re-encrypting the Master Key with a new
   password.   The encrypted password entries are untouched, since
   they are encrypted with the Master Key.</p>

<h2>Backup and Restore</h2>

<p>You should backup your database of passwords from time to time.  To do this
   use Menu -> Backup.   This will create a file named 'oisafe.xml' on
   the sdcard.  Connect your phone to a computer and allow the USB mounting.
   Look for 'oisafe.xml' and copy that to a safe location on your computer.
   The file is encrypted using the same encryption as the database on your phone.</p>

<h2>Import and Export</h2>

<p>You can import data into OI Safe using CSV files.  It is easiest to
   create and manage a CSV within a spreadsheet program like Excel or
   OpenOffice.  Create a file with the following columns in the first row.</p>
   
<table border="1">
 <tr>
   <td>Category</td>
   <td>Description</td>
   <td>Website</td>
   <td>Username</td>
   <td>Password</td>
   <td>Notes</td>
 </tr>
</table>

<p>OI Safe import is very sensitive about the first row,
   so please specify the first
   row exactly like the above list.  You may also find it helpful to
   put some data into the OI Safe and perform an export first, so
   that you can see what the CSV should look like.</p>
   
<p>Use the name 'oisafe.csv' for your filename.   Connect the
   phone to your computer and copy 'oisafe.csv' onto the phone.
   The file must be in the base directory of the phone's USB storage.</p>
   
<p>Once the CSV file is in place, use Menu -> Import to import the file.
   Be sure that your phone is not connected to your computer as the sdcard
   is not allowed to be accessed by both your computer and the phone at
   the same time.</p>

<p>Exporting is a snap.  Just use Menu -> Export.  This will create the
   file 'oisafe.csv'.  Connect your phone to a computer to retrieve
   this file.  
   <div class="warning">WARNING: The exported file is not encrypted!!
   After exporting and working with the file, you should delete it
   as soon as possible!</div></p>
      
<h2>Security Concerns</h2>
 
<p>OI Safe was written to safely store your passwords so that nobody can see
  them other than you.
  The password you use to unlock OI Safe is used to encrypt the data.
  Data is stored within a SQLite database within your phone.   That database stays
  local.  It does not get transferred to the Internet.   In fact, the application
  doesn't have the security privileges to even access the Internet.</p>
  
<p>Because OI Safe cannot access the Internet, the data is not 
  automatically backed up.
  In order to backup, you will need to use Menu -> Backup.</p>

<h3>Locking</h3>

<p>Any of the following actions will cause OI Safe to lock:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The auto lock timer expires.  This may be set to 1, 5 or 30 minutes.
   The default is 5 minutes.</li>
  <li>The screen turns off.  This is a default behavior of the phone and is controlled
   in the phone's Settings -&gt; Sound &amp; display -> Screen timeout.   
   The default timeout is 1 minute.
   After 1 minute the phone will go to sleep.   When this happens, OI Safe will 
   lock itself.</li>
  <li>You select <i>Lock</i> from the Menu on the Categories screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really, the easiest way to lock is to just hit the power button on the phone briefly and
 turn off the screen.</p>
